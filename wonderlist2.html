      <p>Sith philosophy lionizes conflict as a catalyst for growth and as a tool for purging the unworthy.

Members adhere to master morality, are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage.</p>
